## The Path

You decide to follow the path.  

The narrow trail crunches beneath your feet as you push deeper into the forest.  
The trees grow taller and closer together, their branches weaving a canopy that dims the light.  
The air smells of damp earth and moss.  

After a while, you notice something unusual: faint **footprints** in the dirt, leading the same way you’re going.  
They look fresh—too fresh.  

The path soon splits into two directions:  

- **Left** → you hear the faint sound of running water.  
- **Right** → you see smoke curling up between the trees, as if from a campfire.  

**What will you do?**
