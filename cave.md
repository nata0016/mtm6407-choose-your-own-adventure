You decide to explore the dark cave behind you. As you step inside, the light dims and the air grows colder. Your footsteps echo softly against the damp stone walls. Deeper in, you notice strange markings etched into the rockâ€”symbols that seem to glow faintly in the darkness. One symbol resembles a key, and beneath it, a word is carved: "Unlock."

Suddenly, a faint breeze brushes past you, carrying the scent of something metallic and old.

A soft clicking sound echoes somewhere deeper within the cave, hinting that something might have shifted or been triggered. The atmosphere feels charged, as if the cave itself is waiting for your next move.

What will you do next?
