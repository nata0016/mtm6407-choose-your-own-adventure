You decide to explore the dark cave behind you. As you step inside, the light dims and the air grows colder. Your footsteps echo softly against the damp stone walls. Deeper in, you notice strange markings etched into the rockâ€”symbols that seem to glow faintly in the darkness. One symbol resembles a key, and beneath it, a word is carved: "Unlock."

Suddenly, a faint breeze brushes past you, carrying the scent of something metallic and old.

What will you do next?
